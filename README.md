# Nano LLMs

This repository contains LLM architectures and techniques I am currently studying. They are deeply base on awesome well-known resources such as [Stanford's CS336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/) and some of [Karpathy's Youtube Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).

As I add more content, these resources will be updated.

## Roadmap

1. Tokenization
    - [x] Add a simple BPE training implementation in Python.
    - [ ] Add a simple BPE encoding/decoding function.
    - [ ] Upgrade BPE training to consider frequency deltas instead of recounting strategy.
    - [ ] Train Tokenizer on TinyStories.
2. LLM Architecture
